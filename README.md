## 4. üìä Optimize Prometheus Alerting Rules

```text
Help me optimize these Prometheus alerting rules:

[Paste your current alerting rules]

We're experiencing:
- Too many false positives for CPU spikes
- Missing alerts for actual database connection issues
- Alerts that don't provide enough context for triage

Our environment: Kubernetes cluster with 30 microservices, primarily Go and Java applications, PostgreSQL and Redis for storage.
```

## 5. ‚òÅÔ∏è Generate Terraform Code for AWS Infra

```text
Generate Terraform code for AWS infrastructure with:
- Load-balanced web tier in 2 availability zones
- Auto-scaling application tier
- RDS database with read replicas
- S3 for static assets with CloudFront CDN
- Appropriate security groups and IAM roles
- Tags for all resources for cost allocation

Include documentation comments and follow Terraform best practices for organization and variable usage.
```

## 6. üê≥ Troubleshoot Kubernetes Deployment Issues

```text
Troubleshoot this Kubernetes issue:

Symptoms:
- Pods continuously crash and restart
- Error logs show: [paste relevant logs]
- Started after deployment of version 1.4.2 yesterday

Environment:
- GKE Kubernetes 1.26
- Istio service mesh 1.14
- Application uses 1.2GB memory according to resource requests

## 9. üí∏ AWS Cost Optimization Based on Tags

```text
Analyze these AWS cost allocation tags and suggest optimization strategies:

Monthly costs by service:
[Paste your cost breakdown]

Usage patterns:
- Dev environments run 24/7
- Nightly batch processing between 1-4 AM
- Traffic peaks between 9 AM - 6 PM weekdays
- Multiple RDS instances at standard tier
- Several underutilized EC2 instances

Provide:
1. Immediate cost-cutting opportunities
2. Medium-term architectural changes for efficiency
3. Automation suggestions for resource scheduling
4. Recommendations for right-sizing resources
```

## 10. üìù Write a Blameless Postmortem

```text
Help me write a blameless postmortem for this incident:

Incident details:
- 4-hour service disruption on our payment processing system
- Root cause: Database connection pool exhaustion
- Contributing factors: Unexpected traffic spike, insufficient monitoring
- Resolution: Increased pool size, added circuit breakers

Write a comprehensive postmortem that:
1. Focuses on systems and processes, not individuals
2. Clearly explains the timeline and impact
3. Analyzes contributing factors
4. Proposes specific, actionable improvements
5. Highlights what went well in the response
```
